Did requests and curl report the same status and server header?
Yes
If different, what header or other factor might explain it (redirects, default headers, user agent)?

Did the response change (status, server header, content-length) when the User-Agent was MyTestAgent/1.0?
yeah the status is now HTTP/2 200
 server is gunicorn/19.9.0
 content-type is application/json
If it had changed, what could that mean about the server’s defenses?
the server detected the user-agent and responed to it 
the server has a firewall or server rules to defend against knonw scanning agents

What three pieces of information from the steps above would be most useful in a reconnaissance report, and why?
the server headers are useful as it reveals the web server software amd often version numbers. 
the HTTPS status  is useful as is shows whether a virtual host is in use.
it  tells whether curl or a scripting client will follow a redirect by default.
the content-ype is usefel has you find out what the site serves such as html or json. 
The body often contains version banners, JavaScript that reveals frameworks/APIs, comments, or accidentally exposed files

One quick defensive suggestion an admin could use to reduce information leakage from headers.
admins could remove or minimize server identifying headers
